<u>Home<u>

The home page includes today's tops hits in both shows and movies so you will never have to miss what is trending. 
Included is also some of the top movies of all time, and some of the great movies you may have missed from last year. 

<u>Folio<u>

Folio allows you to build your own portfolio of movies that you can rate using professional criteria!
To get started, all you have to do is bookmark any movie, and it will automatically be added into your folio.
There, you can remove movie from your folio or edit their ratings. 

<u>RMP<u>

RMP brings out a set of filters that you can apply to find movies that best fit your interests. 
Don't know what movie to watch? The Single Movie option in RMP gives users a random movie to watch given
their movie preferences. 

<u>Compare<u> 

Sometimes you just need a better perspective between two movies. Whether it be their varying synopsis or perhaps
the difference in rating. Using the Compare page, you can view the details of two movies simultaneously. 

<u>Search<u>

You can lookup any movie or show right on the search bar. Don't know the full title? The search bar recognizes partial
titles and does its best to find the right show or movie.
